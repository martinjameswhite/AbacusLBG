# AbacusLBG
Mock catalogs and fits for LBGs built upon AbacusSummit simulations

Generate mock catalogs using HODs built upon the AbacusSummit (https://abacussummit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) simulations that approximately match measured LBG angular clustering from CARS data. Makes use of the AbacusHOD (https://abacusutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hod.html) software.  Use these mock data to generate synthetic clustering measurements that we can fit with velocileptors (https://github.com/sfschen/velocileptors).
