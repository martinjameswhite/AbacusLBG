Find a tar file attached that contains the w(theta) data for the g- and the u-dropouts. For the g-dropouts I include the original version (_BCsim.dat) and the version with the different integral constraint correction (_Masim.dat). As I said I have only the latter for the u-dropouts, but with the two different versions for the g-dropouts you can get an impression of the size of the effect, or rather lack thereof. I also include the dN/dz histograms (not normalised) corresponding to the right-most case in Fig.5, albeit at slightly lower resolution.
